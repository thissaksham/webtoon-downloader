# webtoon-dl

Download [webtoon](https://www.webtoons.com/en/) comics as PDF or CBZ using a terminal/command line.

## Usage

```shell
# download single episodes
webtoon-dl "<your-webtoon-episode-url>"

# download entire series, default 10 episodes per pdf
webtoon-dl "<your-webtoon-series-url>"

# download as cbz (default is pdf)
webtoon-dl --format cbz "<your-webtoon-series-url>"

# specify a range of episodes (inclusive on both ends)
webtoon-dl --min-ep=10 --max-ep=20 "<your-webtoon-series-url>"

# change the number of episodes per file, e.g. this would create 11 files
webtoon-dl --min-ep=10 --max-ep=20 --eps-per-file=1 "<your-webtoon-series-url>"

# download entire series into a single file (GENERALLY NOT RECOMMENDED)
webtoon-dl --eps-per-file=1000000 "<your-webtoon-series-url>"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The episode numbers specified in `--min-ep` and `--max-ep` will correspond to the URL parameter `&episode_no=`, which may be different from the episode number in the title

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some terminal settings (e.g. [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)) make it so pasted URLs will be [automatically escaped](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/7632).
> You want to EITHER surround your unescaped webtoon URL with double quotes (otherwise you'll get something like a "no matches found" error) OR leave the double quotes off escaped URLs.
> So either of these will work:
> - `webtoon-dl "https://www.webtoons.com/.../list?title_no=123"`
> - `webtoon-dl https://www.webtoons.com/.../list\?title_no\=123`
>
> But this won't work:
> - `webtoon-dl "https://www.webtoons.com/.../list\?title_no\=123"`
